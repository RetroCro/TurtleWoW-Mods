# Personal backup of Turtle WoW's Client Mods, Client Fixes, and Tweaks
**Since the Turtle WoW website and forum are down many of the links from the Wiki are broken and do not work. I scoured through various archive services and cached pages to pull out the download links for all the client mods that I could.**

**This is not a replacement for the Turtle WoW wiki nor should it be treated as such. Use the official wiki!!!**

### 1.3 Darker Nights
While the brightness of night time in 2006 wow is rather dark compared to modern wow, this mod aims to darken things down significantly for a much more immersive feel. 
Duskwood is even darker than the rest, making Darkshire actually true to its name!

### 1.16 Better underwear for High elves
"Have you ever thought that underwear from classic models looks monotonous or boring?
Well THIS MOD IS FOR YOU!
I'm not the best at designing or texturing but I gave the high elves' underwear (for the moment only the female ones), a design according to their race and culture.
Just drag and drop this mod into your "Data" folder and watch the change.
The design will vary depending on the skin color you choose, so it will be a surprise every time you create a new character."

### 1.17 Bigger mouse cursor
Vanilla WoW client has a hard-coded 32x32 pixel sized mouse cursor. We can't adjust it by UI scale nor display resolution. 
When running the game on a modern high DPI display like 4K resolution, the cursor would be too small. 
Vanilla client don't have the in-game option to set cursor size like Retail client.
So here is a modified DXVK which gives a 2X sized cursor, should be enough for 4K display resolution.
It could even enlarge cursor into 3X or 4X size for 8K if needed, by its option.

## 2 Client Fixes and Tweaks
Turtle WoW is a mod on the 1.12 version of the game from late 2006, and as with any old game, tech problems arise. Some issues have been fixed in later versions of WoW, while we are stuck with this version. These mods intend to fix issues, and enhance your experience of playing on Turtle WoW.

### 2.1 VanillaFixes
A client modification for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 to eliminate stutter and animation lag.

There are 2 versions: DXVK (Linux) and Non-DXVK (Windows). The DXVK version is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 8/9/10/11 which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine.

Note: Windows users can use the DXVK version, but performance can be worse. If so, erase all the files from the DXVK version and download the NON-DXVK verison. 

https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes

https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes/releases

### 2.2 Vanilla-Tweaks
Custom patch for the 1.12 client which enables:
- Widescreen FoV fix
- Sound in background patch
- Sound channel count default increase
- Farclip (max render distance) increase
- Frilldistance (max grass render distance) increase
- Frill density (grass density)
- Quickloot reverse patch (hold shift to manual loot)
- Nameplate range change
- CameraDistanceMax limit increase
- Large Address Aware patch
- Camera skip glitch fix

https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks/releases

### 2.3 Nampower
An auto stop-cast tool for World of Warcraft 1.12.1.5875 (for Windows)

There is a design flaw in this version of the client. A player is not allowed to cast a second spell until after the client receives word of the completion of the previous spell. This means that in addition to the cast time, you have to wait for the time it takes a message to arrive from the server. For many U.S. based players connected to E.U. based realms, this can result in approximately a 20% drop in effective DPS.

https://github.com/namreeb/nampower/releases

### 2.4 SuperWoW
SuperWoW is another DLL injection mod that enhances the 1.12 clientside development space to backport some features seen in later versions of WoW, as well as in the Classic re-release.

https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/wiki/Features

https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/releases

### 2.5 Classic-Snowfall
When you keybind an ability and press it, on new WoW clients the ability will activate the moment you press down. However, on Turtle's 2006 client, abilities only activate once you lift your finger off the keypress. Coupled with latency, this adds to a feeling of unresponsiveness.

If you use pfUI's actionbars, simply enable the option "Actionbar -> General -> Trigger Actions On Key Down".

For all other non-pfUI users download: https://github.com/Linae-Kronos/Classic-Snowfall


### 2.6 ImpulseBooster (Not Working)
Need confirmation if this works or not before I add it...


### 2.7 AutoLogin
Those who play Blizzard's official Retail and Classic will know that the launcher is nice in that it lets you automatically log into the game client. Private servers don't exactly have this functionality, but there are tools to help automate logging in for a more seamless experience.

Beware! These solutions store your credentials in plain text readable by any program on your computer... so if a virus/someone hacks your computer, it's possible for your wow password to be stolen!

#### 2.7.1 Turtle AutoLogin
This is recommended for most users, who only have one or just a few accounts. This UI mod adjusts the main login screen and expands the "Remember username" feature to remember everything instead. Important: This mod saves your usernames and passwords in your TurtleWoW/WTF/Config.wtf file, so remember this before sharing this file!

![](https://github.com/RetroCro/TurtleWoW-Mods/blob/main/Pictures/Turtle-AutoLogin.jpg)

Download from the patch-y.mpq file from https://github.com/Haaxor1689/turtle-autologin/releases and place it into your <TurtleWoW/Data/ folder. Launch the game, and you should see on the top right that your accounts are being stored. You can log in and out to test this, and even set if an account should only ever log into a specific character.

#### 2.7.2 (External) AutoLogin
If you have too many accounts that you have ran into the ~220 character limit of Turtle AutoLogin, you might be interested in using this alternative external tool instead.

Place AutoLogin.exe into your TurtleWoW folder. Create a desktop shortcut that runs this AutoLogin.exe. Edit this shortcut's Target field to add the required arguments to the program: It needs to know whtether to load VanillaFixes.exe, loader.exe, or just WoW.exe (depending on if you use the above mods or not), then it needs your username, then the password, and finally the delay in miliseconds of how long to wait before it enters the keypresses.

Once done, the Start In field should look something like D:/TurtleWoW/ while the Target field looks something like "D:/TurtleWoW/AutoLogin.exe" VanillaFixes.exe MyUser MyPass 1000. This shortcut should now seamlessly launch the game with your other mods, and your credentials will be typed in ready for you to hit enter and start playing.

If you are technically experienced, you can devise a batch or shell script to manage all of your accounts in a single script.
