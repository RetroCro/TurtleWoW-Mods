# Turtle WoW - Vanilla Client Install & Setup Guide
> [!NOTE]
> This setup guide does not utilize the official Turtle WoW Launcher which comes with the download. 
> If you decide to use the launcher this guide and these client fixes/mods probably won't work.

The vanilla client is very old. Simple quality of life things like auto loot do not work in the vanilla client. So let's patch WoW.exe and fix some of these issues:

1. Download the game - https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?t=7709
2. Unzip into your C drive - example: C:\twmoa_1172\twmoa_1172 or C:\twmoa_1172
3. Download and install both x86 and x64 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables
	- https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
	- https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
4. Update your graphics drivers
	- AMD - https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html
	- Nvidia - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/
	- Reboot
5. [Automatically clear WDB every launch (Windows)](https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?t=539)
	- Delete the WDB folder
	- Create a new Textfile
	- Name it "WDB" and remove .txt at the end (if you can't see file extensions, you'll have to enable that. Google it, it depends on your OS)
	- It should look like this when you're done
<img align="top" src="https://i.imgur.com/P5VCRFs.png" width="30%">

## Vanilla Tweaks
> These are some custom patches for the old 1.12.1 World of Warcraft client, which lacks many of the conveniences of more modern clients.

The first client fix we will run is called [Vanilla Tweaks](https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks). This will enable widescreen FoV, right click auto loot, increase max camera distance, nameplate range to match TBC, allow the game to use more than 2GB of memory, and more!

1. Download [vanilla-tweaks_v1.6.0_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip](https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks/releases/download/v1.6.0/vanilla-tweaks_v1.6.0_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip) and unzip into your main TWoW folder.
2. Open your main TWoW directory and drag WoW.exe on top of vanilla_tweaks.exe. This will create a new file called WoW_tweaked.exe, which has all the patches applied with their default settings
3. Rename WoW.exe to WoW-OriginalBackup.exe
4. Rename WoW_tweaked.exe to WoW.exe


<details>
<summary>Custom Vanilla Tweaks Settings</summary>
 This is for advanced use cases I suggest using default values!
But if you really want to apply a different value than the default...

Example:  
The default game Field of View (FoV) value in radians is 1.5708. Vanilla Tweaks sets it to 1.925. You want to apply the maximum fov possible: 3.14. 
The max camera distance LIMIT is 50. Vanilla Tweaks does not change this value, but you want to increase it to 100. 

Open Terminal/Powershell at the TWoW directory.


```
.\vanilla-tweaks.exe --fov 3.14 --maxcameradistance 100 WoW.exe
```

After patching WoW.exe, you must run /console CameraDistanceMax 100 in game for this to apply the max camera distance change.
Look [here](https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks/tree/master) and [here](https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks/blob/master/src/main.rs) for more documentation.

## SuperWoW
> made for the 1.12.1 version of World of Warcraft with the purpose of fixing client bugs and expanding the lua-based API used by user interface addons.

[SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) enables a lot of advanced lua features that are not available in the vanilla client. Lots of addons utilize or are greatly enhanced by it. 

1. Download the [latest release zip file](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/releases/tag/Release). 
2. Put SuperWoWhook.dll and the other files into your main TWoW folder.
3. [Download](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the optional compatibility addon, [SuperAPI](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI), which will add a minimap icon allowing you to change SuperWoW settings. 
	- Unzip and put the SuperAPI folder in your Interface\Addons folder: twmoa_1172\Interface\AddOns\SuperAPI
	- Be sure to remove the "-master" from the folder name
<img align="top" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWVPBaN.png" width="40%">

4. [SuperAPI_Castlib](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI_Castlib) (Optional) - Adds castbars to nameplates. If you have latest version of PfUI you won't need this addon.
   - [Download SuperAPI_Castlib](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperAPI_Castlib/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
	- Unzip and put the SuperAPI_Castlib folder in your Interface\Addons folder: twmoa_1172\Interface\AddOns\SuperAPI_Castlib
	- Be sure to remove the "-master" from the folder name

### Virus Warnings
<details>
<summary>More Info</summary>
	
**These are false alerts but do not ignore them**
You will need to add exclusions/exceptions to your AV software for the main Turtle WoW folder, otherwise these client fixes and mods wont work. Why is this happening? Well these client fixes are injected into the WoW executable at startup which can trigger AV software.	

1. Right Click on the Start button
2. Select Settings
3. Select Update & Security
4. Select Windows Security
5. Select Virus & threat protection
	- Real-time protection: Turn it off
6. Scroll down to Virus and Thread Protection Settings
7. Click Manage Settings
8. Click Add or Remove Exclusions
	- From the dropdown, select FOLDER
	- For the path select the main TWoW folder (example: C:\twmoa_1172\twmoa_1172)
9. Go back and re-do the SuperWoW section once this is setup.

https://github.com/pepopo978/SuperwowInstallation
</details>

## Nampower
>There is a design flaw in this version of the client. A player is not allowed to cast a second spell until after the client receives word of the completion of the previous spell. This means that in addition to the cast time, you have to wait for the time it takes a message to arrive from the server. For many U.S. based players connected to E.U. based realms, this can result in approximately a 20% drop in effective DPS.

We will utilize [Pepo's version of nampower](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower) which has even more client fixes such as spell queuing, automatic retry on error, and quickcasting.

1. Download the [latest nampower.dll from the release](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower/releases) page.
2. Put nampower.dll in your main TWoW folder.
3. Download the optional [NampowerSettings](https://github.com/pepopo978/NampowerSettings/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) compatibility addon. This will add a minimap icon allowing you to change various nampower settings.
   	- Unzip and put the NampowerSettings folder in your Interface\Addons folder: twmoa_1172\Interface\AddOns\NampowerSettings
   	- Be sure to remove the "-master" from the folder name. The folder path should look similar to the image below:
<img align="top" src="https://i.imgur.com/OcKJG3S.png" width="40%">

1. Download the latest [UnitXP-SP3-bare.zip](https://github.com/allfoxwy/UnitXP_SP3/releases) from the releases page.
	- Unzip and put the UnitXP_SP3.dll in your main TWoW folder.
	- Copy the UnitXP_SP3_Addon folder to your Interface\Addons folder: twmoa_1172\Interface\AddOns\UnitXP_SP3_Addon
	- Be sure to remove the "-master" from the folder name. The folder path should look similar to the image below:

## VanillaFixes
> A client modification for World of Warcraft 1.6.1-1.12.1 to eliminate stutter and animation lag. 

 [VanillaFixes](https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes) enables Vulkan graphics instead of the old DirectX 9 used by the vanilla client. We will use VanillaFixes to launch the game and it will load all the previous tweaks as well. This will be our game "launcher".

1. Download the latest vanillafixes-X.X.X-dxvk.zip from the [releases](https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes/releases) page.
2. Unzip and put all the files in your main TWoW folder.
3. Download the latest dxvk-gplasync-2.x.x.zip file from the [releases](https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync/-/releases) page.
4. Open the unzipped async folder -> Open the x32 folder -> Copy d3d9.dll from the x32 folder to the main TWoW folder. Say yes if prompted to overwrite.

6. Open dlls.txt from the TWoW folder using notepad and edit it like below:

```
# If you use nampower (https://github.com/namreeb/nampower), it will be loaded by this line
nampower.dll
# If you use SuperWoW (https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW), it will be loaded by this line
SuperWoWhook.dll
# If you use VanillaMultiMonitorFix (https://github.com/Mates1500/VanillaMultiMonitorFix), it will be loaded by this line
# VanillaMultiMonitorFix.dll

# Add your own DLLs below
UnitXP_SP3.dll
```

7. Open dxvk.conf from the TWoW folder using notepad and edit it like below. See additional comments below

```
# DXVK configuration for World of Warcraft

# Set Asynchronus computations via DXVK to address 
# potential microstuttering and other graphical issues
dxvk.enableAsync = True

# Uncomment to set framerate limit
d3d9.maxFrameRate = 244

# Uncomment to force borderless fullscreen
d3d9.enableDialogMode = True

# Enable GPL if supported to reduce stuttering (NVIDIA 473.33+, AMD 24.6.1+)
dxvk.enableGraphicsPipelineLibrary = Auto
# Track pipeline lifetimes to reduce memory usage
dxvk.trackPipelineLifetime = True
# Limit compiler threads to reduce memory usage
dxvk.numCompilerThreads = 4

# Disabled because VanillaFixes sets process DPI awareness
d3d9.dpiAware = False
```

> [!TIP]
> If the game seems to be running worse or you are having other graphical issues after installing VanillaFixes DXVK, then erase those files that came in the dxvk zip and use the **non dxvk** from the release page ex: vanillafixes-1.5.2.zip

You are now ready to start the optimized vanilla wow client!

Run Vanillafixes.exe to start the game. You can create a shortcut to this if you want to put the icon on your desktop or something.

If you did everything correctly you should see this popup:

# Other Tweaks / Fixes

## Vanilla Multi Monitor Fix
> This is a DLL hook based fix for WoW 1.12 client misbehaving when you have multiple monitors connected with differing supported resolutions.

1. Download the latest [VanillaMultiMonitorFix release.zip](https://github.com/Mates1500/VanillaMultiMonitorFix/releases) from the releases page.
	- Unzip and put VanillaMultiMonitorFix.dll in your main TWoW folder.
	- Edit dlls.txt from your main TWoW folder and and remove the # comment from line 6 or where it says: 
	  ```
	  VanillaMultiMonitorFix.dll
	  ```
2. Set `VMMFix_preferred_monitor.txt`'s contents to your desired WoW monitor's index, as shown by running `ShowAllDisplayDevices.exe`.
3. Launch the game using VanillaFixes as it load the dll that you uncommented

## üí•HD Character Modelsüí•
![](https://i.imgur.com/JdMaqso.jpeg)
Previously we were using Redmagejoe's Turtle HD Project Patch-A. He backported playable races with their Legion HD models. His patch also had updates for all NPCs and creatures in the world with their Legion HD versions where available. 

Since that [project has been halted](https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?t=2827) and it not compatible with TWoW 1.17.2, there are two alternatives to pick from....

### Patch-A Option 1 - Watcher's - HD Character Models Only
This is similar to Redmagejoe's Patch-A but contains only HD Character models. I would consider this a safe pick since it's slimmed down which helps reduce the number of potential crashes.

https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?t=12120

### Patch-A Option 2 - Turtle HD (by NeyMey)
Neymey has his own version of a [slimmed down Patch-A](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a1x0oKfp0BGUOWZfleNgkABbHf1AIcBt). This is also a safe pick. 

Neymey also has a [larger "full" version of Patch-A](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OrMT2ec3K22h2BduHXbCNRhS6vCajT7c) which comes close to the original Redmagejoe's Patch-A. If you are willing to accept a higher chance of random crashes this is the patch with the most backported HD graphics.
> NeyMey - "For the least amount of bugs I recommend using the optional patch A (with only player models)"

You will need to download both his Patch A and Patch H mpq's if you decide to use NeyMey' version.

# Troubleshooting
## I am using the launcher and it's not working
The Turtle WoW launcher **DOES NOT WORK** with any of the client tweaks (SuperWoW, Vanillafixes, Nampower, unit XP3, etc) posted above. You cannot use the launcher if you want to enable these. 

## My game crashed when I was in a high populated area like Stormwind Trade district, etc
> This application has encountered a critical error:<br>
> Exception:	0xC0000005 (ACCESS_VIOLATION)<br>
> The memory could not be "read"

This is a known issue when using these HD texture mods especially if you use the larger ~2gb "full" Patch-A. There is a conflict somewhere with one of the HD files in the mpq and custom changes made by Turtle WoW. I don't have a fix for this. 

## My video settings don't show the correct monitor resolution
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AkJu10j.png" width="600">

This can happen for various reasons such as:
 - You're running the game from a laptop which has internal graphics and dedicated graphics.
 - You have multiple monitors and/or different resolutions between them. 
 - Your drivers aren't up to date. 
 - Other OS or Graphics settings
 
This is an issue beyond the scope of this guide. Post all relevant info in the discord support channel before you try installing any mods mentioned above.
