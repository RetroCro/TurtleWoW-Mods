##Client Mods
From https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Client_Mods

###2.1 Turtle HD
This mod backports many character models and textures, as well as environment textures, from Legion and later WoW versions, to Turtle's vanilla client. 
Patch-A (HD models/textures & more): https://github.com/redmagejoe/TurtleHD/releases/download/v1.17.1-1.0b/patch-A.MPQ
patch-B (World and environment visual upgrade): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GQ932XSzsFMKozhGd-a8HPetQI79xcXb/view?usp=share_link
Patch-C (Autoattack weapon sound update): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAldcTI2CFliAvMTYVbURDngHyqVTzCH/view

###2.2 Alt HD
This mod, similar to Turtle HD, backports some assets from retail but with a bigger emphasis on overhauling ground clutter and tilesets.

###2.3 Darker Nights
While the brightness of night time in 2006 wow is rather dark compared to modern wow, this mod aims to darken things down significantly for a much more immersive feel. 
Duskwood is even darker than the rest, making Darkshire actually true to its name!

###2.11	Warcraft 3 Cursors

###2.12	Bikini Mod

###2.13	A little extra for Female High Elves, Humans, Night Elves

###2.14	Autumn Elwynn Reskin

###2.15	Druid beast warrior forms for NE and TA

###2.16	Better underwear for High elves

###2.17	Bigger mouse cursor
Vanilla WoW client has a hard-coded 32x32 pixel sized mouse cursor. We can't adjust it by UI scale nor display resolution. 
When running the game on a modern high DPI display like 4K resolution, the cursor would be too small. 
Vanilla client don't have the in-game option to set cursor size like Retail client.
So here is a modified DXVK which gives a 2X sized cursor, should be enough for 4K display resolution.
It could even enlarge cursor into 3X or 4X size for 8K if needed, by its option.
