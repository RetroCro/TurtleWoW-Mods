### 2.3 Darker Nights
While the brightness of night time in 2006 wow is rather dark compared to modern wow, this mod aims to darken things down significantly for a much more immersive feel. 
Duskwood is even darker than the rest, making Darkshire actually true to its name!

### 2.16	Better underwear for High elves
"Have you ever thought that underwear from classic models looks monotonous or boring?
Well THIS MOD IS FOR YOU!
I'm not the best at designing or texturing but I gave the high elves' underwear (for the moment only the female ones), a design according to their race and culture.
Just drag and drop this mod into your "Data" folder and watch the change.
The design will vary depending on the skin color you choose, so it will be a surprise every time you create a new character."

### 2.17	Bigger mouse cursor
Vanilla WoW client has a hard-coded 32x32 pixel sized mouse cursor. We can't adjust it by UI scale nor display resolution. 
When running the game on a modern high DPI display like 4K resolution, the cursor would be too small. 
Vanilla client don't have the in-game option to set cursor size like Retail client.
So here is a modified DXVK which gives a 2X sized cursor, should be enough for 4K display resolution.
It could even enlarge cursor into 3X or 4X size for 8K if needed, by its option.
